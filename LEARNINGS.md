# Pitch Visual Learnings

## ACTIVE

### STANDING - every rejection becomes a rule

Every Dave rejection of a generated image or layout = new active rule. When Dave says "awful," "bad," "I don't like this," or rejects without elaborating, infer the underlying aesthetic principle that was violated, propose a candidate rule, and write it into `LEARNINGS.md`. Surface the new rule back to Dave in plain language so he can confirm or refine. Never let a rejection pass without a written rule.

### STANDING - design system first

Before ANY image generation or slide visual edit, Codex must read `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and explicitly reference which rules are being applied. No silent drift from the system.

### STANDING - slide backup protocol

Before any edit to a slide, save current state to `backups/slides/[slide-id]/[timestamp]-pre-[description].html` and update `backups/slides/_index.json`.

### STANDING - specific vs autonomous mode

If the prompt names exact creative direction, follow as spec. If the prompt says "make this slide great," "your best shot," "brainstorm and ship," or equivalent, enter creative director mode: read `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, identify the slide's strategic role, synthesize ONE strong concept, generate it, deploy it, and report what changed and why. Never return a menu of 5 options when asked for autonomous mode.

### STANDING - design system reference in prompts

Every image generation prompt and slide edit must reference `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`. No image generation prompt may contradict the locked palette, aesthetic, layout, or banned aesthetics.

### Opener and hero slides require ICONIC register, not LITERAL depiction

The headline states a claim; the image must embody that claim at mythic scale, not illustrate it. Example: headline "the #1 predictor of a fulfilling life" -> wrong response is "two people connecting." Right response is a single specific gesture that operates as a flag-plant. Before generating any hero image, ask: "what is the tattoo version of this idea, not the brochure version?"

### STANDING - full-bleed imagery for big-moment slides

Hero, opener, mission, transition, and big-moment slides use FULL-BLEED imagery. The image fills the slide edge to edge. Type overlays directly on a deliberate quiet zone inside the painting. No image-in-a-box. No cream margins around an embedded image. The painting IS the slide.

### STANDING - hero image aesthetic

Aesthetic for hero slides: warm editorial brush-and-wash painting (Andrew Wyeth x Adrian Tomine), cream-gold-rust-muted-blue palette, NEVER green, painterly soft edges, mythic register.

### STANDING - keep structured slides typographic

Charts, comparisons, data tables, and spec slides keep the existing clean editorial typographic treatment. Do NOT painterify them.

### STANDING - hero subject is one mythic gesture

Hero subject = ONE mythic gesture or moment, not a wide establishing shot. Ambiguous-but-specific. The viewer should feel the gesture before they understand what it is.

### STANDING - permanent banned aesthetics across hero imagery

Permanent banned aesthetics across all hero imagery: two-people-on-porch / Hallmark / memoir / senior-living-brochure register, Mediterranean / villa / terra cotta / olive, Anthropologie catalog vibe, sunset-as-melancholy, photorealism, digital-flat illustration, cartoon, stock "diversity poster" staging, paddle-cluster or four-paddle-flower compositions, paddle-only product shots, fake posed smiles, and object-exchange metaphors that make connection feel transactional.

### STANDING - emotion can be visible

Faces and smiles are allowed on opener images when the slide needs visible emotion. The ban is not "no smiles"; the ban is fake stock-photo warmth, posed diversity-poster staging, or sentimental Hallmark register. A good opener smile should feel observed, specific, and emotionally true.

### STANDING - hands must read capable, not creepy

When hands are the hero subject, they must read active, capable, warm, and alive. Maturity can show through posture, gesture, sun, and texture, but not through exaggerated veins, skeletal knuckles, claw-like fingers, bruised color, or frailty. "Older" should never become the first thing the viewer notices.

### STANDING - typography audit after every slide rebuild

Typography audit is mandatory on every slide rebuild. When a slide's image, layout, or background changes, Codex MUST review the typography against the new context and propose improvements, not preserve as-is. Audit checklist: line breaks must avoid orphaned punctuation and mid-phrase breaks; contrast must read clearly against the new background using text-shadow or tuned color saturation when brand colors fade; hierarchy must weight title size appropriately for slide importance (opener > internal > footer); position must place type in a deliberate quiet zone of the painting, not floating arbitrarily; brand colors stay preserved (#1 predictor gold, "giving" blue, "receiving" rust) but can be tuned for contrast against the new background.

### STANDING - quality pass preserves slide mechanics

A quality pass is polish, not reinvention. Preserve all active slide content, dated iteration comments, click states, controller hooks, and SVG/chart structures unless Dave explicitly asks for a rebuild. Sharpen typography, contrast, spacing, and visual hierarchy inside the existing system; defer tempting content or concept changes for Dave decision.

### STANDING - structured slides use contrast and rhythm, not hero treatment

For structured comparison, chart, title, data, and spec slides, the strongest quality moves are exact brand-color normalization, tighter line rhythm, clearer dashed/void states, and better card spacing. Do not import hero-slide full-bleed imagery or painterly treatment into these slides.

### STANDING - first slide is universal, not the wedge

The first slide must not use pickleball, racquet sports, courts, nets, paddles, balls, club scenes, or other proving-ground imagery. The opener sells the universal human truth before the wedge appears. Use a mythic, non-sport human gesture that lets the thesis text carry the claim: "The #1 predictor of a fulfilling life: openly giving and receiving real connection."

### STANDING - avoid transactional props on connection slides

Do not use keys, envelopes, invitations, documents, gifts, contracts, phones, or other exchanged objects as the emotional center of first-slide connection imagery. If the object becomes the meaning, the slide reads as access, transaction, or administration instead of openly giving and receiving real connection.

### Headline-image tension rule

If the headline makes a civilizational or existential claim, such as "fulfilling life," "next great network," or "predictor," the image must match that scale. A small, intimate, two-person composition under a civilizational headline reads as scarcity and undercuts the argument. Match the scale of the claim.

## SUPERSEDED

### SUPERSEDED 2026-05-14 - BANNED aesthetics for hero images - permanent

- Hallmark-card / memoir-cover / senior-living-brochure register.
- Two-people-talking compositions, any age, any setting.
- Sunset-as-melancholy or sunset-as-ending.
- Anthropologie catalog / wellness-brand vibe.
- Stock-photo "diversity poster" staging.
- Generic "people connecting" framing.

Superseded by the broader permanent banned-aesthetics rule. Dave later clarified that smiles can be right when the opener needs visible emotion; the active ban is fake posed warmth, not faces or smiles themselves.

### SUPERSEDED 2026-05-14 - One specific non-equipment gesture beats a wide establishing shot

A close-up of one mythic human moment, such as a hand reaching across a threshold, a porch light turning on, or a single welcoming wave, is stronger than a wide "see the whole community" frame for any opener or hero slide. The gesture must be emotionally iconic without reducing GnR to pickleball equipment. Save wide shots for context slides, not flag-plant slides.

Superseded by the one-mythic-gesture rule. Equipment may appear only as secondary context when Dave explicitly calls for it; the subject remains the human gesture.

### SUPERSEDED 2026-05-14 - Pickleball equipment is not opener-hero imagery

Pickleball is the wedge and proof environment, not the opening metaphor unless Dave explicitly asks for a pickleball-specific slide. Do not use paddles, balls, nets, court lines, or paddle taps as the primary opener/hero image for civilizational claims like "fulfilling life" or "next great network." Those artifacts make the company feel like a club-sports product instead of a human-connection network.

Superseded because the opener is now universal and must not use pickleball, racquet sports, courts, nets, paddles, balls, club scenes, or other proving-ground imagery. Save wedge imagery for wedge/community proof slides.

### SUPERSEDED 2026-05-14 - Suburban American anchor is non-negotiable for community/wedge imagery

No Mediterranean, no villa, no European architecture, no terra cotta, no olive trees, no cosmopolitan-cafe register. GnR's wedge is suburban American pickleball clubs. Every hero image should be unmistakably set there or in a register compatible with it.

Superseded because the first slide is now explicitly universal and must not use pickleball, racquet sports, club scenes, or proving-ground imagery. Keep the suburban American anchor for wedge/community slides only.

### SUPERSEDED 2026-05-14 - Hero and opener slides must use FULL-BLEED imagery

Hero and opener slides must use FULL-BLEED imagery, not embedded-with-margins. The image fills the slide edge to edge; title and subtitles overlay directly on a deliberately quiet zone within the painting. Cream margins around an embedded image reads as wellness-magazine, not Khosla-tier pitch deck. The painting IS the slide, and the painting must be composed with the title location in mind.

Superseded by the broader full-bleed rule covering hero, opener, mission, transition, and big-moment slides.

### SUPERSEDED 2026-05-14 - One specific gesture beats a wide establishing shot

A close-up of one mythic moment, such as a paddle tap, a hand reaching across, or a single welcoming wave, is stronger than a wide "see the whole community" frame for any opener or hero slide. Save wide shots for context slides, not flag-plant slides.

Superseded because Dave rejected the paddle image. The corrected rule preserves specific-gesture thinking but bans literal pickleball equipment as opener/hero metaphor unless explicitly requested.
